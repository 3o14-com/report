Scientific communication on mainstream social media platforms is often hindered by a lack of support for mathematical notation, academic citations, and decentralized data control. This report presents the development of a federated social media platform designed specifically for researchers and academics, built using the ActivityPub protocol. The platform enables seamless sharing of scientific content while maintaining interoperability with the broader Fediverse. Key features include support for scientific typesetting, user-friendly server deployment, and the ability for institutions and individuals to host their own instances without losing connectivity. By leveraging decentralization and federation, this project provides a privacy-conscious, accessible, and academically enriching alternative to existing platforms. This report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of the system, highlighting the challenges faced and the solutions developed.
